Installing
==========

Before installation, please check your Vim supports python by running :echo has('python'). 1 means you're all set; 0 means you need to install a Vim with python support. If you're compiling Vim yourself you need the 'big' or 'huge' feature set.

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing pathogen.vim, and then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/sigidagi/vim-cmake-project.git

Or for Vundle users:

Add Plugin 'sigidagi/vim-cmake-project' to your ~/.vimrc and then:

    either within Vim: :PluginInstall
    or in your shell: vim +PluginInstall +qall

Usage
=====
Open "cmake" project file "CMakeLists.txt" with vim. CMake project file not necessary have to be
in current working directory. 

You can generate native makefiles and workspaces by this command:

    :CMakeBuild

Compile project 

    :CMakeCompile

Clean project - remove binary files generated by cmake

    :CMakeClean

If project is running on "tmux" all outputs is provided on separate
window/pane. Output window will open as soon as above commands are executed.
To close output window use following command:

    :CMakeOutput

To toggle bar window with project files issue following command:

    :CMakeBar

For navigation and usage of tree list in bar window refer to "NERDTree" plugin help
